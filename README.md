This is a Chrome extension that let's you turn any webpage in to a 3d asteroids-like game, except it's very unfinished and works best on simple pages like news.ycombinator.com and craigslist.com

### Installation
Works the same as any in-development Chrome extension: open 'manage extensions', enable developer mode, click 'load unpacked' and point it to this project's root folder. Enable the extension.

### Running
As long as the extension is enabled you'll see a big circular, teal play button in the upper right corner of every page. Click it to launch the 'game'.

### Controls
- A,S,D,W: fly around
- K: enter asteroids mode
