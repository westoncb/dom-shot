Setting z-position of meshes needs to take into account zIndex of DOM element

The bounds we're calculating for dom elements using getBoundingClientRect seem off sometimes
in comparison to how dom-to-image is rendering. It's likely dom-to-image is to blame. Maybe
we can compute tile bounds from layout info in dom-to-image to ensure they're in sync.

Fix tile edge coloring (maybe get calc a color summary from tile surface and use that)

For debugging: render the output of dom-to-image to a plain canvas so you can see what you're working with.
    Or what's probably equivalent: just set ELEMENT_DEPTH to 0.001


Note: we use a specific commit in dom-to-image-improved as a dependency because there is
a fix we need that hasn't been published to NPM yet (related to not crashing when an img can't be loaded)
